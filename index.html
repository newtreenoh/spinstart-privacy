# SpinStart Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** February 15, 2026  
**Last updated:** February 15, 2026

SpinStart (“we”, “us”, “our”) provides a mobile productivity app that helps users choose tasks, run focus timers, and review progress insights.

## 1. Data We Collect

SpinStart may process:

- Task and app data you enter (for example: task text, energy tag, priority, completion state, timer state)
- App usage events (for example: spins, completions, timer outcomes, extension events)
- Technical/device data (for example: app version, OS version, device model)
- Subscription status and purchase metadata from app stores (Google Play / Apple App Store)
- Optional cloud backup payloads when cloud backup is enabled

SpinStart does **not** intentionally collect direct personal identifiers such as name, phone number, or precise location for core app use.

## 2. How We Use Data

We use data to:

- Provide app functionality (tasks, spin selection, timers, insights)
- Save and restore backups
- Maintain subscriptions and Pro access
- Improve app reliability and product quality using anonymized usage insights
- Protect the service from abuse and fraud

## 3. Cloud Backup

Cloud backup is optional and consent-based.  
When enabled, backup data is transferred over encrypted channels (TLS) and stored using Firebase services.  
Backups are intended for restore functionality and service continuity.

## 4. Third-Party Services

SpinStart may use:

- Google Firebase (for backup/sync/auth/infrastructure and related app services)
- Google Play Billing / Apple in-app purchase services (for subscription and purchase processing)

Payment card details are handled by the app store provider, not directly by SpinStart.

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not sell personal data.  
We may share data only with service providers needed to operate the app (for example, cloud hosting, billing infrastructure), subject to contractual and security controls.

## 6. Data Retention

- Local app data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.
- Cloud backup data is retained while backup functionality is active and may be replaced by newer backups.
- We retain data only as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this policy.

## 7. Security

We apply reasonable technical and organizational safeguards, including encrypted transport and secure service configurations, to protect data against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.

## 8. Your Choices and Rights

You can:

- Disable cloud backup consent in app settings
- Uninstall the app to remove locally stored data
- Request help regarding privacy or data deletion by contacting us

Depending on your region, you may have rights under laws such as GDPR/CCPA (for example access, deletion, correction, portability, objection).

## 9. Children’s Privacy

SpinStart is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.

## 10. International Processing

Data may be processed in countries other than your own through our service providers. We take steps intended to protect data in line with applicable law.

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. We will post updates at this URL and revise the “Last updated” date.
